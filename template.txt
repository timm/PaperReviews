Section 1 (Sat morning) Search Based Software Testing

Andrea Arcuri and Gordon Fraser, Java Enterprise Edition Support in Search-Based JUnit Test Generation
Notes: EvoChecker mentioned; not familiar topic

HOMI: Searching Higher Order Mutants For Software Improvement
Notes: 
	Best paper
	Test at GNU open soure program
	Combines Deep Parameter Optimisation  (the result figure)

Jingyao Geng, Zheng Li, Ruilian Zhao and Junxia Guo, Search based Test Suite Minimization for Fault Detection and Localization: a co-driven method
Notes: 
	TSM for Fault Detection and Fault Localization
	3 objs: test suite reduction ratio, code coverage ratio, #statement partitions
	(C) I don't like the charts (too large)


Section 2 (Sat afternoon) Software Validation
Angelo Gargantini, Justyna Petke, Marco Radavelli and Paolo Vavassori, Validation of Constraints among Configuration Parameters using Search-Based Combinatorial Interaction Testing
Notes:
	(C) Configurable systems. QoS
	Combinatorial Interaction Testing (?)
	Constraints also in CNFs. But not highly contrainted
	Six policies (UC CC CV CuCV ValC CCi)

Simone Scalabrino, Giovanni Grano, Dario Di Nucci, Rocco Oliveto and Andrea De Lucia, Search-based Testing of Procedural Programs: Iterative Single-Target or Multi-Target Approach?
No comments

Basil Eljuse and Neil Walkinshaw, A Search Based Approach for Stress-Testing Integrated Circuits
Cant understand :(

Discovering Tradeoffs, Vulnerabilities, and Stakeholder Dependencies in a Changing World
Keynote1
MOVA framework -- might be useful

Section 34 (Sun) SBSE Foundations
Vivek Nair, Tim Menzies and Jianfeng Chen, An (Accidental) Exploration of Alternatives to Evolutionary Algorithms for SBSE
Notes:
	One questioned: whether sway can only apply specific problems? What kind of problems we can apply the SWAY

Vin√≠cius Paulo L. Oliveira, Celso G. Camilo-Junior, Claire Le Goues and Eduardo F. de Souza, Improved crossover operators for genetic programming for program repair
Notes:
	Program repair (based on GenProg)
	Automated repair benchmarks http://repairbenchmarks.cs.umass.edu/
	no more comments

Thammasak Thianniwet and Myra Cohen, Scaling up the Fitness Function for Reverse Engineering Feature Models
Notes:
	not familiar with reverse engineering

Phil McMinn and Gregory Kapfhammer, AVMf: An Open-Source Framework and Implementation of the Alternating Variable Method
Notes:
	(**) an local search technique: alternating variable method

David Brevet, Takfarinas Saber, Goetz Botterweck and Anthony Ventresque, Preliminary Study of Multi-objective Features Selection for Evolving Software Product Lines
Notes:
	Propose eSATIBEA which is better than SATIBEA
	we can improve both the execution time and the quality of SATIBEA by **feeding it with the previous configurations**: our solution converges nearly 10 times faster and getsan 113% improvement after one generation of genetic algorithm
	Ableto solve the problem with dyanmaic modifying

Section56 (Mon)
Keynote speaker #3: Prof. Yew-Soon Ong, Towards Evolutionary Multitasking: A New Paradigm
Notes:
	Put two problems together and solve them at the same time.
	3 types of problem overlap: 1) same variables 2) partial same variables 3) totally different variables
	Only test in the simple problems/ artificial problems
